### Welcome

Hey builders, welcome to the Versatus family where every line of code contributes to a larger vision â€“ one where development is intuitive, accessible, and empowering. We know building smart contracts and decentralized applications in Web3 can seem complicated, exclusive, and exhaustive as a developer. Thatâ€™s because currently, it is. But it doesnâ€™t have to be that way, and it definitely wonâ€™t stay that way with Versatus.

### Who We Are

Versatus is the Universal Decentralized Application (dApp) Engine that allows all developers to truly build without barriers.

### Why Build on Versatus

### Flexibility
Developers can build smart contracts in familiar programming languages such as Rust, JavaScript, Go, C++, Python, C, and more. Eliminating the barriers to entry in blockchain development invites a wider pool of talent and doing so breeds familiarity efficiency and creativity, leading to more quality and diverse applications.

### Cross-Chain Settlement
In a blockchain ecosystem that is becoming increasingly fragmented, the ability to interact across different chains is invaluable. Versatus provides the necessary infrastructure for their developers to integrate contracts on their blockchain network(s) of choice.

### Scalability
 By allowing off-chain execution of smart contracts, Versatus developers benefit from reduced operational costs, improved scalability, and overall enhanced dApp performance and user experience. 

Unlike other projects, we wonâ€™t pigeonhole you into a certain or limited range of languages or a single chain. There is no Web3 prerequisite or steep learning curve. Rather than struggling with new languages and tools, our developers can focus on innovating their dApps.

### High Level Roadmap

This is extremely high level, for each **Epic** there are multiple features
and under each feature there are many stories and tasks

_Items that are more than 50% complete are marked with :construction: while
items that are less than 50% complete are marked as :x:, all items marked with
:white_check_mark: are complete, tested, and integrated into the node runtime_

### Starting a Node

In order to start a node, run `cargo run`
Running `cargo run -- -help` will display available cli flags for node configuration and management.

**The above builds and runs a Versatus node in `debug` mode** to run in optimized
release mode you must first build the release target using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/versatus/versatus
cd /path/to/cloned/repo
cargo build --release
```

This will produce a target file (and directory if this is your first time
running `cargo run` or `cargo build` in this repo.

Then, to display the available CLI flags, you can run:

```
cd target/release
./versatus -help
```
