### Welcome

Hey builders, welcome to the Versatus family where every line of code contributes to a larger vision – one where development is intuitive, accessible, and empowering. We know building smart contracts and decentralized applications in Web3 can seem complicated, exclusive, and exhaustive as a developer. That’s because currently, it is. But it doesn’t have to be that way, and it definitely won’t stay that way with Versatus.

### Who We Are

Versatus is the Universal Decentralized Application (dApp) Engine that allows all developers to truly build without barriers.

### Why Build on Versatus

### Flexibility
Developers can build smart contracts in familiar programming languages such as Rust, JavaScript, Go, C++, Python, C, and more. Eliminating the barriers to entry in blockchain development invites a wider pool of talent and doing so breeds familiarity efficiency and creativity, leading to more quality and diverse applications.

### Cross-Chain Settlement
In a blockchain ecosystem that is becoming increasingly fragmented, the ability to interact across different chains is invaluable. Versatus provides the necessary infrastructure for their developers to integrate contracts on their blockchain network(s) of choice.

### Scalability
By allowing off-chain execution of smart contracts, Versatus developers benefit from reduced operational costs, improved scalability, and overall enhanced dApp performance and user experience.

Unlike other projects, we won’t pigeonhole you into a certain or limited range of languages or a single chain. There is no Web3 prerequisite or steep learning curve. Rather than struggling with new languages and tools, our developers can focus on innovating their dApps.

### Get Started Building on Versatus
If you are keen to build on Versatus, apply to our [BetaNet Developer Program](https://versatus.io/apply#application-form). All developers are welcome, no blockchain experience necessary. 
Once accepted, you can start with the [Smart Contracts Developer Guide](https://docs.versatus.io/developer-guide/smart-contracts/introduction/overview) and [Reference Guide](https://docs.versatus.io/reference-guide/versatus-wasm-command-reference)
