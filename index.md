Versatus is a fast, scalable Layer 1 blockchain truly designed for mass adoption.
Versatus is powered by a novel consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Claim, which
features dual-scalability for record-breaking TPS and fast time to finality.
Versatus offers a flexible, composable and safe, (programming) language agnostic
compute platform powered by unikernel containers. The Versatus compute platform
takes web3 beyond the paradigm of ownership, tokenization and event
triggered transfers, offering a decentralized general execution environment
that can deliver on the promise of a decentralized internet and financial

Versatus provides the most flexible developer experience available on any
smart contract platform, allowing developers to build in any language they
choose. Beyond language agnosticism, Versatus programs are secure by design,
allowing developers to spend more time thinking about building core
business logic and design. This provides developers with shorter roadmaps,
lower audit costs, leads to fewer bugs, less maintenance, and ultimately,
will lead to better end user experiences.

### High Level Roadmap

This is extremely high level, for each **Epic** there are multiple features
and under each feature there are many stories and tasks

_Items that are more than 50% complete are marked with :construction: while
items that are less than 50% complete are marked as :x:, all items marked with
:white_check_mark: are complete, tested, and integrated into the node runtime_

### Starting a Node

In order to start a node, run `cargo run`
Running `cargo run -- -help` will display available cli flags for node configuration and management.

**The above builds and runs a Versatus node in `debug` mode** to run in optimized
release mode you must first build the release target using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/versatus/versatus
cd /path/to/cloned/repo
cargo build --release
```

This will produce a target file (and directory if this is your first time
running `cargo run` or `cargo build` in this repo.

Then, to display the available CLI flags, you can run:

```
cd target/release
./versatus -help
```
