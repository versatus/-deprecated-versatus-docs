# Overview

Whether you're new to development of smart contracts for blockchain, or if you have experience with traditional smart contract platforms, there will be some differences when developing smart contracts on Versatus. The catalysts for these differences have been:
1. Ease of development -- especially for those not already familiar with smart contract development
2. Language agnosticism -- we feel that you shouldn't need to learn a new language, compiler, IDE, debugger to develop smart contracts.
3. Security -- even if you're new to smart contract security
4. Scale -- by executing off-chain, more parallel compute jobs can be executed at once

This document aims to be a good starting point for anyone learning to develop smart contracts for Versatus, regardless of the language(s) and tools you intend to develop in.
